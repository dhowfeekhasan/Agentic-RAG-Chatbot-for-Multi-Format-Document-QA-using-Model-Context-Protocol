5. CREATE 

Additionally, there are other commands like DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, etc. However, the 5 basic commands are the most commonly used. 

Note: The provided context does not contain a clear list of SQL commands. The above answer is based on general SQL knowledge. 

In total, there are around 10-15 SQL commands, but the exact number can vary depending on the database management system being used. 

For example, some popular SQL commands include:
- SELECT: retrieves data from a database table
- INSERT: adds new data to a database table
- UPDATE: modifies existing data in a database table
- DELETE: deletes data from a database table
- CREATE: creates a new database table or other database object
- DROP: deletes a database table or other database object
- ALTER: modifies the structure of a database","programmingvalley.com HH i || WHERE salary BETWEEN 3000 ANO 6000; SEES Ot emoioees: \WhERe bass (SELECT + FROM || ‚ÄòSELECT corn, column FROM tbl; ‚ÄòSELECT FROM users; ‚ÄòSELECT department, COUNTI¬Æ) || (WHERE oteersuneis= wer aa WHERE 99¬¢ > 25 AND stats ete || SQL Mind Map l SELECT * FROM Urs WHERE name LE WERE department NCH TI: || (WHERE oteersuneis= wer aa WHERE 99¬¢ > 25 AND stats ete || (WHERE oteersuneis= wer aa WHERE 99¬¢ > 25 AND stats ete || (WHERE oteersuneis= wer aa WHERE 99¬¢ > 25 AND stats ete || (WHERE oteersuneis= wer aa WHERE 99¬¢ > 25 AND stats ete || (WHERE oteersuneis= wer aa WHERE 99¬¢ > 25 AND stats ete",jpeg,success,

A hardware-based load balancer is a hardware appliance that can securely process and redirect gigabytes of traffic to hundreds of different servers. You can store it in your data centres and use virtualization to create multiple digital or virtual load balancers that you can centrally manage. Hardware-based load balancers are dedicated boxes which include Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) adapted for a particular use. ASICs allow high-speed promotion of network traffic and are frequently used for transport-level load balancing because hardware-based load balancing is faster in comparison to a software solution.
